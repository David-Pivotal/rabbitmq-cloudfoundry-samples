RabbitMQ Cloud Foundry Samples
==============================

This repository contains sample applications to demonstrate the use of
the RabbitMQ service on Cloud Foundry
(<http://www.cloudfoundry.com/>).

You can find further sample applications at
<https://github.com/SpringSource/cloudfoundry-samples>.  In
particular, the 'stocks' application
<https://github.com/SpringSource/cloudfoundry-samples/tree/master/stocks>
uses the RabbitMQ service.

If you have any questions about these samples or the service, please
contact us using the forums on support.cloudfoundry.com
(<http://support.cloudfoundry.com>).
